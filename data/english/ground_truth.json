The liability of the\nSubprocessor shall be limited to its own Processing operations under the Clauses.\n\n24\n\n\f(4)\n\nIn addition to the Data Exporter's entitlement to terminate the Clauses in accordance with\nClause 5(a), either Party may terminate these Clauses if: (i) the Registrar makes a\ndesignation under section 4 of the Regulations which remains in force, in relation to each\njurisdiction in which the Data Importer and each of its Subprocessors is incorporated or\noperates or uses the Personal Data; or (ii) each such jurisdiction not so designated is added\nto the list in Schedule 3 to the Regulations.\n\n(5)\n\nThe Parties agree that the termination of these Clauses at any time, in any circumstances\nand for whatever reason (except for termination under sub\u2010clause (4)) does not exempt\nthem from the obligations and/or conditions under the Clauses as regards the Processing of\nthe Personal Data transferred.\n\n7.\n\nMediation and jurisdiction\n\n(1)\n\nThe Data Importer agrees that if the Data Subject invokes against it Third Party beneficiary\nrights and/or claims of compensation for damages under the Clauses, the Data Importer will\naccept the decision of the Data Subject\u2013\n(a)\n\nto refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable,\nby the Registrar; and\n\n(b)\n\nto refer the dispute to the Court.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Parties agree that the choice made by the Data Subject will not prejudice its substantive\nor procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or\ninternational law.\n\n8.\n\nCooperation with the Registrar\n\n(1)\n\nThe Data Exporter shall be entitled to deposit a copy of these Clauses with the Registrar if\nthe Registrar so requests or if such deposit is required under the Regulations.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Parties agree that the Registrar has the right to exercise its functions and powers\noutlined in section 14 of the Regulations in respect of the Data Importer and any\nSubprocessor, in the same scope and subject to the same conditions as would apply to a\nData Processor of the Data Exporter under the Regulations.\n\n9.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.\n10.\n\nVariation of the clauses\n\nThe Parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses except to update any information in Annex\nA. This does not preclude the Parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required,\nas long as they do not contradict the Clauses.\n11.\n\nSubprocessing\n\n(1)\n\nThe Data Importer shall not subcontract any of its Processing operations performed on\nbehalf of the Data Exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the Data\nExporter. Where the Data Importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses with the\nconsent of the Data Exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the\n\n25\n\n\fSubprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the Subprocessor as are imposed on\nthe Data Importer under the Clauses. This may be satisfied by the Subprocessor executing\nand becoming bound contractually by the Clauses as entered into between the Data\nExporter and the Data Importer. Where the Subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection\nobligations under such written agreement, the Data Importer shall remain fully liable to the\nData Exporter for the performance of the Subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.\n(2)\n\nThe prior written contract between the Data Importer and the Subprocessor shall also\nprovide for a Third Party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the Data\nSubject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in Clause 6(1) against the\nData Exporter or the Data Importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased\nto exist in law or have become insolvent, and no successor entity has assumed the entire\nlegal obligations of the Data Exporter or Data Importer by contract or by operation of law.\nSuch third party liability of the Subprocessor shall be limited to its own Processing\noperations under the Clauses.\n\n(3)\n\nThe provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred\nto in sub\u2010clause (1) shall be governed by the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Data Exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the\nClauses and notified by the Data Importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at\nleast once a year. The list shall be made available to the Registrar.\n\n12.\n\nObligation after the termination of Personal Data Processing services\n\n(1)\n\nThe Parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data Processing services, the\nData Importer and the Subprocessor shall, at the choice of the Data Exporter, return all the\nPersonal Data transferred and the copies thereof to the Data Exporter or shall destroy all the\nPersonal Data and certify to the Data Exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed\nupon the Data Importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the Personal\nData transferred. In that case, the Data Importer warrants that it will guarantee the\nconfidentiality of the Personal Data transferred and will not actively process the Personal\nData transferred any further.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Data Importer and the Subprocessor warrant that upon request of the Data Exporter\nand/or of the Registrar, it will submit its data Processing facilities for an audit of

BABEL 8 TTT NNT AIEEE\n\nPREAMBLE\nThe Member States of the African Union:\nGuided by the Constitutive Act of the African Union adopted in 2000;\n\nConsidering that this Convention on the Establishment of a Legal Framework for\nCyber-security and Personal Data Protection embodies the existing commitments\nof African Union Member States at sub-regional, regional and international levels to\nbuild the Information Society,\n\nRecalling that it aims at defining the objectives and broad orientations of the\nInformation Society in Africa and strengthening existing legislations on Information\nand Communication Technologies (ICTs) of Member States and the Regional\nEconomic Communities (RECs);\n\nReaffirming the commitment of Member States to fundamental freedoms and\nhuman and peoples\u2019 rights contained in the declarations, conventions and other\ninstruments adopted within the framework of the African Union and the United\nNations;\n\nConsidering that the establishment of a regulatory framework on cyber-security and\npersonal data protection takes into account the requirements of respect for the rights\nof citizens, guaranteed under the fundamental texts of domestic law and protected\nby international human rights Conventions and Treaties, particularly the African\nCharter on Human and Peoples' Rights;\n\nMindful of the need to mobilize all public and private actors (States, local\ncommunities, private sector enterprises, civil society organizations, the media,\ntraining and research institutions, etc.) for the promotion of cyber security,\n\nReiterating the principles of the African Information Society Initiative (AISI) and the\nRegional Action Plan on the Knowledge Economy (ARAPKE),\n\nAware that it is meant to regulate a particularly evolving technological domain, and\nwith a view to meeting the high expectations of many actors with often divergent\ninterests, this convention sets forth the security rules essential for establishing a\ncredible digital space for electronic transactions, personal data protection and\ncombating cybercrime;\n\nBearing in mind that the major obstacles to the development of electronic\ncommerce in Africa are linked to security issues, particularly:\n\na) The gaps affecting the regulation of legal recognition of data\ncommunications and electronic signature;\n\n \n\n \n\f \n\n \n\n1: ART RT HER TE PET ST IE\n\n2\n\nb) The absence of specific legal rules that protect consumers, intellectual\nproperty rights, personal data and information systems;\n\nc) The absence of e-services and telecommuting legislations;\n\nd) The application of electronic techniques to commercial and\nadministrative acts;\n\ne) The probative elements introduced by digital techniques (time

cultural,\neconomic and social environment; and that the objective of this Convention is\ntherefore to provide the necessary security and legal framework for the emergence\nof the knowledge economy in Africa;\n\nStressing that at another level, the protection of personal data and private life\nconstitutes a major challenge to the Information Society for governments as well as\nother stakeholders: and that such protection requires a balance between the use of\ninformation and communication technologies and the protection of the privacy of\ncitizens in their daily or professional lives, while guaranteeing the free flow of\ninformation;\n\nConcerned by the urgent need to establish a mechanism to address the dangers\nand risks deriving from the use of electronic data and individual records, with a view\nto respecting privacy and freedoms while enhancing the promotion and development\nof ICTs in Member States of the African Union;\n\nConsidering that the goal of this Convention is to address the need for harmonized\nlegislation in the area of cyber security in Member States of the African Union, and\nto establish in each State party a mechanism capable of combating violations of\nprivacy that may be generated by personal data collection, processing, transmission,\nstorage and use; that by proposing a type of institutional basis, the Convention\nguarantees that whatever form of processing is used shall respect the basic\nfreedoms and rights of individuals while also taking into account the prerogatives of\nStates, the rights of local communities and the interests of businesses; and take on\nboard internationally recognized best practices;\n\nConsidering that the protection under criminal law of the system of values of the\ninformation society is a necessity prompted by security considerations, that is\n\n \n\f \n\n \n\naed eatin ced STL\n\n3\n\nreflected primarily by the need for appropriate criminal legislation in the fight against\ncybercrime in general, and money laundering in particular;\n\nAware of the need, given the current state of cybercrime which constitutes a real\nthreat to the security of computer networks and the development of the Information\nSociety in Africa, to define broad guidelines of the strategy for the repression of\ncybercrime in Member States of the African Union, taking into account their existing\ncommitments at sub-regional, regional and international levels;\n\nConsidering that this Convention seeks, in terms of substantive criminal law, to\nmodernize instruments for the repression of cybercrime by formulating a policy for\nthe adoption of new offences specific to ICTs, and aligning certain offences,\nsanctions and criminal liability systems in force in Member States with the ICT\nenvironment;\n\nConsidering further that in terms of criminal procedural law, the Convention\ndefines the framework for the adaptation of standard proceedings concerning\ninformation and telecommunication technologies and spells out the conditions for\ninstituting proceedings specific to cybercrime;\n\nRecalling Decision Assembly/AU/Decl.1(XIV) of the Fourteenth Ordinary Session\nof the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union on\nInformation and Communication Technologies in Africa: Challenges and Prospects\nfor Development, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

With rising expectations\ntowards continuous availability of services, immaculate user experience and\neffective protection of sensitive data, the strengthening of Saudi Arabia\u2019s\ncybersecurity becomes crucial to increase the digital nation\u2019s trust in safe and\nresilient ICT infrastructure and services.\n\n2.\n\nPurpose\nThe CRF provides requirements for better management of cybersecurity risks\nthrough a consistent approach and in line with international best practices and\nlocal cybersecurity regulations. The purpose of the CRF is:\n\u2022 To regulate and empower the cybersecurity practices of the ICT sector.\n\u2022 To increase the overall cybersecurity maturity level of the ICT sector.\n\u2022 To define a comprehensive set of cybersecurity requirements that shall be\nimplemented based on a risk-oriented approach.\n\u2022 To encourage the ICT sector to apply good practices for establishing the\nappropriate cybersecurity measures.\n\u2022 To ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the services provided\nto the customers.\n\n3.\n\nScope\nThis CRF provides a comprehensive set of cybersecurity requirements that must\nbe implemented by the LSPs to fulfill the minimum security requirements.\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of CITC regulations and other related\nregulations, the provisions of this Framework shall apply to licensed service\nproviders. It is important to understand that this framework is not intended to\noverwrite, and should not be perceived as a replacement of any of the issued\nregulatory frameworks.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 3 of 52\n\n\f4.\n\nApplicability\nThis framework is applicable to all the LSPs and their subsidiaries, staff, third\nparties and customers. Each LSP is required to comply with all applicable\nrequirements through developing their own way of achieving the cybersecurity\nobjectives.\nBecause the requirements were chosen to be comprehensive, some requirements\nmight not be applicable for every LSP. For example if an LSP does not develop\nsoftware, then compliance with the secure software development (Category ID:\n4.14) requirements will not be required in this case. The control will remain\napplicable in case software is developed via a third party.\n\n5.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\nResponsibilities of CITC include:\n1. Monitor and steer the LSPs compliance with the\ndefined requirements through various ways, for\nexample inspections of LSPs facilities, compliance\nworkshops, active and reactive audits.\n2. Periodically review and update the CRF.\n3.\nDefine compliance requirements and setting target\ndates to ensure LSPs compliance with the CRF.\nResponsibilities of the LSPs include:\n1. Adopt and implement CRF in accordance with the\ndefined compliance requirements.\n2. Provide compliance reporting through for example\nself-assessments or other different means upon\nrequest from CITC.\n3. Provide information and documentation to CITC\nwhen requested in addition to the defined reporting\nin the CRF.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 4 of 52\n\n\f6.\n\nGlossary\n\nThe words and expressions defined in CITC Statutes shall have the same meaning when used\nin this document.

Each level comprises of a set of cybersecurity controls. The\nthree levels vary in the complexity of the controls.\nLevel 1 includes the basic security controls.\nLevel 2 includes advanced requirements in addition the existing requirements\nwithin Level 1.\nLevel 3 includes requirements that are focusing on efficiency monitoring and\ncontinuous improvement to the controls in Levels 1 and 2.\nIn order to achieve compliance with a higher level, compliance with all preceding\nlevels is required.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 10 of 52\n\n\fLevel 3\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 1\n\nFigure 1 - Compliance Levels\n\nThe criticality of the LSP defines the target compliance level and date, which will\nbe officially communicated by CITC (via e.g. memos, website).\n2.\n\nStructure of the controls\nThe CRF controls are grouped into six domains:\n\nFigure 2 - CRF Domains\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 11 of 52\n\n\fEach domain is broken down into more specific categories that group\ncybersecurity controls relevant to the specific topic and share the same objective.\n\nFigure 3 - CRF Domains and Categories\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 12 of 52\n\n\fFigure 4 - CRF Structure\n\nImportant notes\nParticular control information such as [processes], [outcomes], and\n[references] (e.g. to other controls, categories, processes, CITC documents) are\nindividually highlighted throughout the framework. Where applicable,\nspecific] control considerations are highlighted as well.\n\n[ICT-\n\nThe controls within the CRF are interconnected, for example an outcome from\na control in one category could be an input to another control within a different\ncategory (e.g. the [Vulnerabilities Report] generated in the Vulnerability\nManagement category acts as an input to the Patch Management category).\nThe highlighted processes and outcomes cover most but not necessarily all\ncybersecurity measures. They just emphasize expected implementations of\nprocesses and outcomes to improve the usability and clarity of the CRF\ncontrols.\nThe symbols used in the CRF are listed below:\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 13 of 52\n\n\fCRF Symbol Legend\nNew Outcome\nOutcome\nNew Process\nProcess\nReference\nICT-specific\n3. Documentation of Requirements\nIn almost all CRF categories, documenting the requirements will be the first\nstep of the implementation by the LSP. The CRF does not prescribe a standard\nformat for the documentation of the requirements mentioned in each of the\ncategories. These requirements can be defined in form of directives, rules,\nstandards or policy documents. However, the requirements document \u2013\nregardless of its name \u2013 must at least include the following:\nUnique document title\nDocument version number and date\nDocument change tracker\nDocument owner responsible for changes\nThe requirements document must be officially approved by the authorized\npersonnel/committee within the organization\n\u2022 The requirements documents must be appropriately disseminated and\ncommunicated to all relevant stakeholders within the organization\n\u2022 Roles and responsibilities for the definition and the approval of the\nrequirements of the category.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nDocuments that do not fulfil the above requirements will not be qualified to be\ncompliant with the control requirements.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 14 of 52\n\n\f4.

The controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational\nmeasures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or\naccidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular when\nthe processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all\nother unlawful forms of processing.\n\n\f2. The measures provided for in 1 above must ensure, considering the state of the\nart and the cost of their implementation, such measures shall ensure an adequate\nlevel of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing face and\nthe nature of the data to be protected.\n3. When processing is carried out on his behalf, the controller must choose a\nprocessor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical security\nmeasures and organisational measures governing the processing to be carried\nout, and must ensure compliance with those measures.\n4. The carrying out of processing by way of a processor must be governed by a\ncontract or legal act binding the processor to the controller and stipulating in\nparticular that the processor shall act only on instructions from the controller and\nthat the obligations referred to in 1 shall also be incumbent on the processor.\n5. Proof of the will to negotiate, the contract or the legal act relating to data\nprotection and the requirements relating to the measures referred to in 1 shall be\nin writing in a supporting document legally certified as affording proof.\nArticle 16\n(Special security measures)\n1. The controllers of the data referred to in paragraphs of 1, in 2 and 5 of Article 8\nand in 1 of Article 9 shall take adequate measures and added information\nsecurity, particularly to:\na) prevent unauthorised persons access to the premises used for processing data\n(control of entry to the premises);\nb) prevent data media from being read, copied, altered/modified by\nunauthorised persons (control of data media);\nc) prevent unauthorised input as well as unauthorised obtaining of knowledge,\nthe alteration or elimination of personal data input (control of input);\nd) prevent automatic data processing systems from being used by unauthorised\npersons by means of data transmission premises (control of use);\ne) guarantee that authorised persons may only access data covered by\nauthorisation (control of access);\nf) guarantee the checking of entities to whom personal data may be transmitted\nby means of data transmission premises (control of transmission);\ng) guarantee that it is possible to check a posteriori, in a period appropriate to\nthe nature of the processing, the establishment in the regulations applicable\nto each sector of which personal data are introduced, when and by whom\n(control of input);\nh) prevent unauthorised reading, copying, altering, or eliminating of data in\ntransmitting and transporting personal data (control of transport).\n2. Taking account of the nature of the entities responsible for processing and the\ntype of premises in which it is carried out, the CNPD may waive the existence of\ncertain security measures, subject to guaranteeing respect for the fundamental\nrights, freedoms and guarantees of the data subjects.\n3. The systems must guarantee the logical separation between data relating to\nhealth and sex life, including genetic data, and other personal data.\n\n\f4. Where circulation over a network of the data referred to in 8 and 9 may\njeopardise the fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees of their data\nsubjects, the CNPD may determine that transmission must be encoded.\nArticle 17\n(Processing confidentiality)\nAny person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor, including the\nprocessor himself, who has access to personal data must not process them except on\ninstructions from the controller, unless he is required to do so by law.\nArticle 18\n(Professional secrecy)\n1.Controllers and persons who obtain knowledge of the personal data processed in\ncarrying out their functions shall be bound by professional secrecy, even after their\nfunctions have ended.\n2.Members of the CNPD shall be subject to the same obligation even after their\nmandate has ended.\n3.The provision in the previous numbers shall not exclude the duty to supply the\nobligatory information according to the law, except when it is contained in filing\nsystems organised for statistical purposes.\n4.Officers/agents or staff who serve as consultants for the CNPD or its members are\nsubjected to the same obligation of professional secrecy.\nCHAPTER III\nTransfer of personal data\nSECTION I\nArticle 19\n(Principles)\n1. Without prejudice to the following Article, the transfer of personal data which\nare undergoing processing or intended for processing may only take place\nsubject to compliance with the present Law and other legislation applicable to\nissues of personal data protection and, undergoing processing for transfer to\nanother State, a country which has an adequate level of data protection.\n2. The adequacy of the level of protection shall be assessed in light of all the\ncircumstances surrounding a data transfer or set of data transfers, in particular,\nthe nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing, the\ncountry of origin and country of final destination, the rules of law, both general\nand sectoral, in force in the State in question, as well as the professional rules\nand security measures which are complied with in that country.\n3. It is for the CNPD to decide whether a foreign State ensures an adequate level of\nprotection.\nArticle 20\n\n\f(Derogations)\n1. The transfer of personal data to a State which does not ensure an adequate level\nof protection within the context of 19 2) may be allowed by the CNPD if the data\nsubject has given his unequivocal consent to the proposed transfer or if that\ntransfer:\na) is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and\nthe controller of the processing the data or the precontractual measures taken\nin response to the request of the subject;\nb) is necessary for the execution/performance or the signing of a concluded or\nto be concluded contract in the interest of the data\u2019s subject between the\ncontroller and a third party;\nc) is necessary or legally required on the grounds of important public interest,\nor for the establishment, exercise of defence of legal claims;\nd) is necessary for the protection of vital interests of the data\u2019s subject;\ne) is made from a public register, within the contexts of the laws or regulations,\nis intended for information of the public and which is open to consultation\neither by the general public or by any person who can demonstrate legitimate\ninterest provided the conditions laid down in law for consultation are\nfulfilled in this case.\n2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the CNPD may authorise a transfer or set of\ntransfers of personal data to a State which does not ensure an adequate level of\nprotection within the meaning of Article 19 2) for as long as the processing\ncontroller provides adequate guarantees with respect to the protection of the\nprivacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and with respect to\ntheir exercise, particularly by means of appropriate contractual clauses.\n3. The transfer of personal data which is necessary for the protection of State\nsecurity, defence, public safety and the prevention, investigation and repression\nof punishable criminal offences shall be governed by special legal provisions or\nby the international conventions to which Cape Verde is party.\nCHAPTER IV\nNational authority for the investigation of the protection of personal data\nSection I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 21\n(Objectives of the investigation)\nThe supervisory of personal data protection shall seek to follow-up, evaluate and control\nthe activities of legally competent organs or services for its processing, safeguarding the\nfulfilment of the Constitution and the Law, especially the fundamental rights, freedoms\nand guarantees of citizens.\nArticle 22\n(Nature of the investigation)\n\n\f1.

        "title": "Czech Republic (List of activities which require a DPIA)",
        "input": "List of processing operations subject to data protection impact assessment\nOffice for Personal Data Protection of the Czech Republic\nThis document develops on the WP29 Guidelines on Data Prtoection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and\ndetermining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation\n2016/679. This paper is neither definitive nor exhaustive and can be subject to eventual\namanedments to keep up with the technology development, changes in the legal environment, etc.\nEach controller should carry out an analysis of the data processing operations. The method of such\nanalysis is explained below.\nMethod\nWhen drafting the solution, the Czech SA proceeded from the Guidelines on Data Prtoection Impact\nAssessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the\npurposes of Regulation 2016/679 which describe the method of how to identify data processing\noperations entailing high risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects on the grounds of defined\ncharacteristics.\nWhen evaluating the degree of risk related to a data processing, it is necessary to capture the nature\nof the operation by means of of characteristics which enable to describe every data processing\noperation and subsequently to determine on the basis of values of these characteristics whether the\nprocessing belong to the high-risk category or not. A pre-defined scale or range, i.e. a list of values or\nintervals of values (hereinafter \u201cthe values\u201d) that each individual characteristics can acquire shall be\nused. Each processing thus can be described by a unique set of values. Then the values per\ncharacteristics shall be sorted into three (at maximum) groups according to the level, where each\ngroup is marked differently, i.e. critical values in red, siginificant values in yellow and low values in\ngreen. A processing qualifies as a high-risk operation, if the value of two or more characteristics\nattains red (critical) or one parameter hits red (critical) and, at the same time, five values at least hit\nyellow (significant):\n\u25cf Each characteristics shall be included by taking into account only one single level (the highest one)\n\u25cf If the level (intensity) of two or more characteristics hit a critical limit, the DPIA shall be carried out\n\u25cf If one characteristics hits critical level and, at the same time, five characteristics at least reaches a\nsiginificant level, the DPIA shall be carried out then.\n(Note: It is not possible, in drafting the method, to presume compliance with specific prerequisites (for\ninstance meeting of some technical or organizational measures like data pseudonymisation) or\ninfluence of specific factors (for instance taking into account threats with effect on the processing).\nThese considerations shall be part of the DPIA itself, which is a subsequent step (where on the basis of\nan analysis one arrives at the conclusion that the data processing entails high risks to the rights and\nfreedoms of data subjects)).\n\n1\n\n\fMethod recommended to controllers \u2013controllers should look, if the processing in question happens\nto be on the list of operations for which no DPIA is required. In other words, the controller should\ndetermine in the first place, whether the intended or already performed processing is covered by an\nexemption from the obligation to carry out a DPIA (for example, in case of processing carried out by a\npublic authority on a legal basis, could it be possible that the processing brings about a high level of\nrisk, but a full-bodied DPIA might have been done during the legislative consultation procedure, and\nconsequently, the controller, in accordance with the list of processing operations that are not subject\nto DPIA, does not need to carry out this exercise). If the controller\u00b4s processing is not exempt (it\ncannot be found on the list of processing opertions not subject to DPIA), then a DPIA pursuant the\ncriteria presented in this document is mandatory.\nIf the analysis shows the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data\nsubjects, the controller will have to do a DPIA (identification of risks, threats and technical and\norganizational measures intended to reduction or elimination of those risks). The controller obtains\nthrough the elaboration of a DPIA sufficient information that help introduce appropriate technical\nand organizational measures. It will be furthermore secured that the adopted measures are not\ninsufficient (not providing sufficient protection of personal data) or, the other way round, not\nunnecessarily stringent (thus needlessly expensive in most cases).\nAnalysis of data processing operations\nProcessing including monitoring of data subjects (criterion 3 in the guidelines)\nData subjects are identifiable/identified and localizable\n\u25cf\n(Note: It concerns foremost the processing of data capturing physical movement or location of\nidentified/identifiable data subjects, namely through their geographic coordinates. A normal use of a simple\nfootage and other monitoring of employees will qualify for this category only in case that the employee\nmonitoring shall determine their movements or continuously monitor their activity (possible interference\nwith the Labour Code). In such a case the condition presented at the beginning must be met (at least one\nother characteristics on the critical level (red) or five characteristics on siginficant level (yellow) are\nnecessary to ground the render a DPIA mandatory).

INTRODUCTION\nThis Guidance Note provides general advice on the requirement for organisations to carry out\na Data Protection Impact Assessment (\u201cDPIA\u201d) for any high-risk data processing activity. It is\nimportant to note that DPIAs are not a new concept, as they were a recognised procedure\nthat organisations used to comply with data protection law under the previous regime, namely\nthe EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the \u201cDirective\u201d).\nA DPIA is a procedure designed to assist organisations identify and minimise the privacy risks\nof new projects or policies. A DPIA is an important tool for accountability that will help\norganisations comply with the requirements under the EU General Data Protection Regulation\n2016/679 (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) and the Data Protection Act 2004 (the \u201cDPA\u201d), including the\nrequirement for organisations to demonstrate that appropriate measures have been\nimplemented to ensure compliance with data protection. Where a DPIA identifies high risks\nwhich the organisation cannot mitigate, the organisation will be obliged to consult with the\nLead Supervisory Authority before engaging in the process.\nIt is important to note that conducting a DPIA is not mandatory for all data processing, it is\nonly required where the intended processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk to the rights and\nfreedoms of natural persons\u201d (Article 35(1) of the GDPR)1. For example, this will be a\nrequirement when a new technology is being used, where a profiling operation is likely to\nsignificantly affect individuals, or where there is large scale monitoring of a publicly accessible\narea.\nAlthough undertaking a DPIA is not always compulsory, organisations may find it useful to\nconduct one as, if done correctly, it will help to ensure processing is GDPR compliant.\nThe aim of this guidance note is to provide advice on the GDPR\u2019s requirements relating to\nDPIAs and to assist data controllers with their role throughout this task, as they are ultimately\nresponsible for ensuring that DPIAs are carried out according to GDPR requirements. The\ninformation provided should therefore be treated as guidance, with appropriate consideration\nbeing given to the actual legal requirements. Footnotes referencing the legislation are included\nso that readers are able to link and relate the guidance to the specific provisions in the law.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWhere appropriate Gibraltar\u2019s Information Commissioner will seek to ensure that locally published guidance\ndocuments are consistent with others made available by fellow Commissioners in other jurisdictions.\nAs well as reflecting the existing data protection standards and practices in Gibraltar, parts of this document reflect\nand/or incorporate the guidance from the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s office.\n\n1\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, a DPIA is required as stipulated in Section 73(1) of the DPA.\n\n1\n\n\f2. WHAT IS A DPIA?\nGDPR - Article 35(7)\nThe assessment shall contain at least:\n(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of\nthe processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the\ncontroller;\n(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in\nrelation to the purposes;\n(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in\nparagraph 1; and\n(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures\nand mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance\nwith this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects\nand other persons concerned.\n\nThe GDPR does not formally define the concept of a DPIA2, however it can be described as a\nprocess that aims to identify and minimise the privacy risks of any given data\nprocessing activity.\nWhilst the GDPR does not define what a DPIA consists of in absolute terms, as can be seen\nfrom the requirement above, it sets out specific features that must be included in a DPIA3 \u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n2\n\na description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the\nprocessing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the\ncontroller;\nan assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing;\nan assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;\nthe measures envisaged to - address the risks; and\n- demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(2) of the DPA.\n\n3\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(3) of the DPA, which sets out the specific features that\nmust be included in a DPIA.\n\n2\n\n\fAlthough the above-mentioned features are mandatory, the list is non-exhaustive and flexible\nin that organisations may include additional features and adapt the DPIA as appropriate for\nthe type of data used and processing intended4.\nFor illustrative purposes, the Commissioner considers the following to be a useful outline of a\nDPIA in practice -\n\nStep 1: identify the need for a DPIA in relation to the envisaged processing operations and\npurposes (where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller);\nStep 2: assess necessity and proportionality of the processing;\nStep 3: identify the privacy and related risks to the rights of individuals;\nStep 4: identify and evaluate the measures to address risks (privacy solutions);\nStep 5: sign off and record/document the DPIA outcomes to demonstrate compliance;\nStep 6: integrate the outcomes into the project plan.\nThis DPIA process is flexible and can be integrated with an organisation\u2019s existing approach\nto managing projects. Importantly, it is not a static document and should be kept under review\nso that it may be amended in the event that any changes in circumstances require it to be\nadapted accordingly.\n\n2.1. What does a DPIA address?\nA DPIA may concern a single data processing operation or a set of similar processing\noperations that present similar high risks. In this respect, Recital 92 of the GDPR states that:\n\n\u201cThere are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject\nof a DPIA to be broader than a single project, for example where public authorities or bodies\nintend to establish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers\nplan to introduce a common application or processing environment across an industry sector\nor segment or for a widely used horizontal activity.\u201d\nThe above means that a single DPIA may be used to assess multiple processing operations,\nwhich are similar in terms of the risks presented and the specific nature, scope, context and\npurposes of the processing. This may be the case where similar technology is used to collect\nthe same sort of personal data, for the same purposes.\nThis is also applicable to similar processing operations implemented by various data\ncontrollers. In these cases, a reference DPIA should be shared or made publicly available,\nmeasures in the DPIA must be implemented, and a justification for conducting a single DPIA\nmust be provided.\nFor example, a group of companies that are each setting up a similar CCTV system could carry\nout a single DPIA covering the processing by these separate controllers, or a restaurant chain\n(single controller) could cover video surveillance in all its restaurants with one DPIA.\n\n4\n\nOrganisations can develop their own DPIA framework depending on their circumstances, data included and\nproposed processing, as long as it contains the mandatory features.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2. Joint controllers\nIf the processing operation involves joint controllers, then each controller should define their\nrespective obligations precisely. Their DPIA should then set out which controller is responsible\nfor the various measures designed to manage risks and to protect the rights of the data\nsubjects.\nA DPIA may also allow controllers to assess the data protection impact of a technology\nproduct, such as hardware or software, where this is likely to be used by different data\ncontrollers to carry out different processing operations. In this respect, it is important to note\nthat the data controller who deploys the product will be obliged to carry out its own DPIA in\nrespect of the implementation of that product. In certain cases, this may be informed by a\nDPIA prepared by the product provider.\n\n3. WHEN IS A DPIA REQUIRED?\nThe GDPR does not require a DPIA to be performed for every processing operation which may\nresult in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. A DPIA should however be performed\nwhen the processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural\npersons\u201d (see Article 35(1) of the GDPR)5.\nThe need for a DPIA is particularly relevant when a data controller is considering introducing\na new data processing technology. Article 35(3) of the GDPR6 provides data controllers with\nsome examples of when a DPIA is required.\nGDPR - Article 35(3)\nA data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be\nrequired in the case of:\n(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons\nwhich is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are\nbased that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly\naffect the natural person;\n(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or\nof personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or\n(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\n\n5\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(1) of the DPA.\n\n6\n\nWhilst Part III of the DPA does not provide a list of examples, Section 73(4) of the DPA stipulates the\ninformation that must be considered when determining whether a type of processing is likely to result in a \u201chigh\nrisk\u201d.\n\n4\n\n\fThe above is meant as a non-exhaustive list. There may be processing operations that are not\ncaptured in Article 35(3) of the GDPR which may be considered \u201chigh risk\u201d and should be\nsubject to a DPIA. For this reason, the Article 29 Working Party 7 included in their guidelines\na set of criteria that should be considered when assessing whether the processing is likely to\nresult in a high risk.\nThis section aims to help data controllers identify when the processing of personal data is\nlikely to be high-risk and require a DPIA prior to the processing.\n1. Evaluation or scoring:\nThis includes profiling and predicting, especially from \u201caspects concerning the data\n\nsubject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or\ninterests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements\u201d (Recitals 71 and 91 of the\nGDPR). Examples may include a financial institution that screens its customers against a\ncredit reference database or an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing or\nfraud database, a biotechnology company offering genetic tests directly to consumers in\norder to evaluate and predict the disease/health risks, an online gambling company\nbuilding/using behavioural profiles to predict or alert on account activity, or a company\nbuilding behavioural or marketing profiles based on usage or navigation on its website.\n2. Automated decision making with legal or similar significant effect:\nThis refers to processing that aims at taking decisions on data subjects producing \u201clegal\neffects concerning the natural person\u201d or which \u201csimilarly significantly affects the natural\nperson\u201d (Article 35(3)(a) of the GDPR). For example, the processing may lead to the\nexclusion or discrimination against individuals. However, processing with little or no effect\non individuals does not match this specific criterion.\n3. Systematic monitoring:\nThis refers to processing used to observe, monitor or control data subjects, including data\ncollected through \u201ca systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area\u201d (Article 35(3)(c)\nof the GDPR)8. This type of monitoring is a criterion as personal data may be collected in\ncircumstances where the data subject is unaware of who is collecting their personal data\nand how their data will be used. Additionally, it may be impossible for individuals to avoid\nbeing subject to such processing in publicly accessible spaces.\n\nThe Article 29 Working Party (\u201cWP29\u201d) was the independent European working party that dealt with issues\nrelating to the protection of privacy and personal data until 25 May 2018 (entry into application of the GDPR).\nThe WP29 has now been replaced by the European Data Protection Board (\u201cEDPB\u201d). References in this document\nshall therefore be to the EDPB, even though the same may relate to guidance originally published by its\npredecessor, the WP29.\n7\n\nThe EDPB interprets \u201csystematic\u201d as meaning one or more of the following:\n- occurring according to a system;\n- pre-arranged, organised or methodical;\n- taking place as part of a general plan for data collection;\n- carried out as part of a strategy.\nThe EDPB interprets \u201cpublicly accessible area\u201d as being any place open to any member of the public, for example\na piazza, a shopping centre, a street or a public library.\n8\n\n5\n\n\f4. Sensitive data or data of a highly personal nature 9:\nThis includes special categories of data as defined in Article 9 of the GDPR (for example\ninformation about individuals\u2019 political opinions), as well as personal data relating to\ncriminal convictions or offences (see Article 10 of the GDPR)10. For example, this would\ninclude a general hospital keeping patients\u2019 medical records or a private investigator\nkeeping offenders\u2019 details.\nMore general types of data that might fall under this category are location data, financial\ndata (that might be used for payment fraud) or electronic communication data. In this\nregard, whether the data has already been made publicly available by the data subject or\nby third parties may be relevant. The fact that personal data is publicly available may be\nconsidered as a factor in the assessment if the data was expected to be further used for\ncertain purposes. Additionally, information processed by a natural person in the course of\npersonal or household activity, such as email services, diaries, e-readers with note-taking\nfeatures and various life-logging applications that may contain very personal information,\nwould all be included in this criterion.\n5. Data processed on a large scale:\nWhilst Recital 91 of the GDPR provides some guidance in relation to large scale processing\noperations, the GDPR does not define what constitutes \u201clarge-scale\u201d. Therefore, the\nCommissioner interprets this to mean a relatively significant data processing activity,\ntaking account of the following factors a. the number of data subjects concerned, either as a specific number or as a\nproportion of the relevant population;\nb. the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed;\nc. the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity; and\nd. the geographical extent of the processing activity.\n6. Datasets that have been matched or combined:\nThis would refer to data that may originate from two or more data processing operations\nperformed for different purposes and/or by different data controllers, in a way that could\nexceed the reasonable expectations of the data subject.\n7. Data concerning vulnerable data subjects (Recital 75 of the GDPR):\nThis form of data processing may require a DPIA given the increased power imbalance\nbetween the data subject and the data controller, meaning that the individual may be\nunable to consent to, or oppose, the processing of their data.\n9\n\nNote, if sensitive data or data of a highly personal nature are not processed systematically and on a large scale,\ntheir processing does not automatically present high risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. For\nexample, a data controller organizing a corporate event, may like to know what kind of food his guests are allergic\nto, and could process these sensitive data exceptionally without needing to perform a DPIA. Similarly, processing\nof special categories of data by a medical doctor in a one-person practice should not be considered \u201clarge scale\u201d\n(Recital 91 of the GDPR).\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, Section 44(3) of the DPA stipulates the cases in which a \u201ccompetent\nauthority\u201d (as defined in Section 39(1) of the DPA) may engage in sensitive personal data processing lawfully.\n10\n\n6\n\n\fFor example, employees would often meet serious difficulties to oppose to the processing\nperformed by their employer, when it is linked to human resources management. Similarly,\nchildren can be considered as not able to knowingly and prudently oppose or consent to\nthe processing of their data. This type of processing also poses further concern on the\nmore vulnerable section of our population who require special protection, such as mentally\nill individuals, asylum seekers, the elderly, or those who are patients. In these cases there\nwould be an imbalance in the relationship between the position of the data subject and\ndata controller.\n8. Innovative use or applying technological or organisational solutions:\nThis may include the combined use of fingerprint and facial recognition for improved\nphysical access control, etc. The GDPR makes it clear (see Article 35(1) and Recitals 89\nand 91 of the GDPR) that the use of a new technology would require a DPIA, given this\ncan involve new forms of data collection and usage, which may result in a high risk to\nindividuals\u2019 rights and freedoms. A DPIA would aid the data controller to understand and\naccount for any potential personal and/or social consequences the processing might have.\nFor example, certain \u201cInternet of Things\u201d applications could have a significant impact on\nindividuals\u2019 daily lives and privacy, therefore requiring a DPIA.\n9. When the processing in itself \u201cprevents data subjects from exercising a right or using a\nservice or a contract\u201d (Article 22 and Recital 91 of the GDPR):\nThis includes processing performed in a public area as individuals may not be able to avoid\nthe processing, or any processing that aims at allowing, modifying or refusing data\nsubjects\u2019 access to a service or entry into a contract. An example of this is where a bank\nscreens its customers against a credit reference database in order to decide whether to\noffer them a loan.\n\nThe EDPB maintains that the more a processing operation meets the above criteria, the more\nlikely it is to present a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, and therefore the\nmore likely it is to require a DPIA.\nAs a general rule, if a processing operation meets at least two of the above criteria, then a\nDPIA will be required. However, in some cases, a processing meeting only one of these criteria\nmay require a DPIA due to the inherent high risk. Conversely, a processing operation may\nmeet at least two criteria, but a data controller may decide that the processing is of a low risk\nand not carry out a DPIA. In this case, reasons would need to be thoroughly documented for\nnot carrying out a DPIA in order to comply with the GDPR.\nThere might be cases where a data controller is unsure whether a DPIA is required. In these\ncases, the Commissioner recommends that a DPIA is still carried out as it is considered a\nuseful tool that will help data controllers comply with data protection laws.\nThe following figure illustrates how specific types of data processing may or may not meet\nrelevant criteria for a DPIA.\n\n7\n\n\fNotwithstanding that an organisation may determine that a processing activity does not meet\nthe criteria that triggers the requirement to carry out a DPIA, it is important to note that under\nthe GDPR a data controller is still required to \u201cmaintain a record of processing activities under\nits responsibility\u201d. This should include, amongst other things, the purposes of the processing,\na description of the categories of data and recipients of the data, and \u201cwhere possible, a\n\ngeneral description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article\n32(1)\u201d (Article 30(1) of the GDPR)11.\nIn accordance with Article 35(4) of the GDPR, the Commissioner will publish a list of processing\noperations that are considered to require a DPIA (see ANNEX B). For the avoidance or doubt,\nthe list will be non-exhaustive, and the absence of a data processing operation on this list\nshould not be seen as an indication that a DPIA is not required. The list will be updated in\naccordance with developments.\n\n4. WHEN IS A DPIA NOT REQUIRED?\nA DPIA is not required when the processing of personal data is not \u201clikely to result in a high\nrisk\u201d, has already been authorised, or has a legal basis.\n\n11\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, Section 70 of the DPA contains provisions relating to records of\nprocessing activities and Section 71 of the DPA contains provisions relating to logging.\n\n8\n\n\fIn summary, a DPIA is not required in the following circumstances:\n\u2022\n\nWhere the processing is \u201cnot likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of\nnatural persons\u201d (see Article 35(1) of the GDPR)12.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhere the processing operations have been checked by the supervisory authority before\nMay 2018 and specific conditions have not changed.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhen the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing are very similar to the\nprocessing for which a DPIA has been carried out. In these cases, the results of a DPIA,\nfor similar processing operations, may be used (see Article 35(1) of the GDPR).\n\n\u2022\n\nWhere a processing operation has a legal basis in the EU or Gibraltar law and has stated\nthat an initial DPIA does not have to be carried out, where the law regulates the specific\nprocessing operation, and where a DPIA, according to the standards of the GDPR, has\nalready been carried out as part of the establishment of that legal basis (see Article 35(10)\nof the GDPR).\n\n\u2022\n\nWhere the processing is included in a list of processing operations (established by the\nsupervisory authority) for which no DPIA is required (see Article 35(5) of the GDPR and\nANNEX C). The list may contain processing activities that comply with the conditions\nspecified by the supervisory authority, in particular, through guidelines, specific decisions\nor authorizations, compliance rules, etc.\n\n5. EXISTING PROCESSING OPERATIONS\nIt is important to note that under the GRPR, organisations are required to undertake a DPIA\nwhen significant changes are made to existing data processing activities (see Article 35(11)\nof the GDPR). For example, when a new technology has come into use or because personal\ndata is being used for a different purpose13. In such cases, the processing in effect becomes\na new data processing operation and therefore, could require a DPIA.\nRisks can change as a result of modification to one of the components of the processing\noperation (data, supporting assets, risk sources, potential impacts, threats, etc.) or because\nthe context of the processing evolves (purpose, functionalities, etc.). In both cases new\nvulnerabilities may emerge. Therefore, it is important to note that the revision of a DPIA is\nnot only beneficial for continuous improvement, but also vital to ensure an adequate level of\ndata protection in a changing environment over a longer period of time.\nLastly, a DPIA may also become essential because the organisational or societal context for\nthe processing activity has changed, for the reason that the effects of specific automated\n\n12\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(1) of the DPA.\n\n13\n\nThe EDPB means this to include terms of context, risks, purposes, personal data processed, recipients, data\ncombinations, security measures and international transfers.\n\n9\n\n\fdecisions have become more significant, new categories of natural persons become vulnerable\nto discrimination.\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that a DPIA is not required for processing\noperations which were checked by the supervisory authority or the data protection official, in\naccordance with Article 20 of the Directive, and that are performed in a way that has not\nchanged since the prior checking.\nConversely, any data processing whose conditions of implementation have changed since the\nprior checking performed by the supervisory authority or the data protection official and which\nare likely to result in a high risk, should be subject to a DPIA. Further, a DPIA may be required\nafter a change of the risks resulting from the processing operations (in terms of the context,\nthe data collected, purposes, functionalities, recipients, data combinations, etc.). For instance,\nbecause of the use of a new technology or because personal data is being used for a different\npurpose.\nOn the other-hand, certain changes could lower the risk and a review of the risk analysis made\ncan show that the performance of a DPIA is no longer required.\nThe EDPB suggest that a DPIA should be continuously carried out on existing processing\nactivities as a matter of good practice, and be re-assessed after three years, depending on\nthe nature of the processing and rate of change in the operation and general circumstances.\nSimilarly, they also recommend that data processed before May 2018, which is not subject to\na DPIA, should be re-assessed three years after this date or sooner, to ascertain that risks to\nthe rights and freedoms of data subjects are still mitigated.\n\n6. PERFORMING A DPIA\nIn this section advice is provided on how to conduct a DPIA, including the point at which it\nshould be carried out, by whom, and the methodology.\n\n6.1 At what point should a DPIA be carried out?\nGDPR \u2013 Article 35(1)\nWhere a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account\nthe nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk\nto the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing,\ncarry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the\nprotection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing\noperations that present similar high risks.\n\n10\n\n\fAs outlined above and in Recital 90 of the GDPR, a DPIA should be carried out \u201cprior to the\nprocessing\u201d of personal data14. This is consistent with the data protection by design and by\ndefault principles (see Article 25 and Recital 78 of the GDPR)15.\nThe following diagram illustrates the basic principles relating to DPIAs under the GDPR:\n\nA DPIA should be carried out as early as practicable in the design of the processing operation,\neven if some of the processing operations are unknown. As a DPIA is updated throughout its\ndevelopment, it will ensure that data protection and privacy are considered, and it will allow\nthe controller to develop solutions that ensure compliance.\nData controllers should be prepared to repeat individual steps of the assessment as the\ndevelopment process progresses, particularly when a processing operation is dynamic and is\nsubject to continuous change.\n\n6.2 Who is obliged to carry out the DPIA?\nUnder the GDPR, the data controller is responsible for ensuring that a DPIA is carried out\n(Article 35(2) of the GDPR). Whilst a DPIA may be conducted by someone else, inside or\noutside the organisation, the data controller remains accountable for that task.\n\n14\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(1) of the DPA, which stipulates that a DPIA should\nbe conducted \u201cprior to the processing\u201d.\n15\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 66 of the DPA.\n\n11\n\n\fThe data controller must seek advice from the Data Protection Officer (DPO)16 where\ndesignated (Article 35(2) of the GDPR) and this consultation, including any decisions taken,\nshould be documented within the DPIA. The DPO should also monitor the performance of the\nDPIA (Article 39(1)(c) of the GDPR)17.\nWhere the processing is wholly or partly performed by a data processor, the processor should\nassist the controller in conducting the DPIA, taking into account the nature of the processing\nand the information available to the processor (Article 28(3)(f) of the GDPR).\nThe controller must also \u201cseek the views of data subjects or their representatives\u201d (Article\n35(9) of the GDPR), \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d. The EDPB considers that \u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthese views can be acquired through a variety of means, depending on the context (for\nexample, studies related to the purpose and means of the processing, a formal question\nto the staff representatives or trade/labour unions, or a survey sent to the data controller\u2019s\nfuture customers);\nif the data controller\u2019s final decision differs from the views of the data subjects, its reasons\nfor going ahead or not should be documented; and\nthe controller should also document its justification for not seeking the views of data\nsubjects, if it decides that this is not appropriate.\n\nIt is good practice to define and document other specific roles and responsibilities, depending\non internal policy, processes and rules. For example \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nbusiness departments proposing to carry out a DPIA should provide input and be involved\nin the validation process of the DPIA;\nwhere appropriate, professionals should be consulted (lawyers, technicians, security\nexperts, sociologists, ethics professionals, etc.);\nthe roles and responsibilities of the processors must be contractually defined;\nif the Chief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d), if appointed, or the DPO suggests that\nthe data controller carries out a DPIA on a specific processing operation, they should help\nthe stakeholders with the methodology, assist in the evaluation of the risk assessment\nand whether the residual risk is acceptable, and contribute to the development of\nknowledge specific to the data controller context; and\nthe CISO, if appointed, and/or the IT department, should provide assistance to the data\ncontroller, and could propose to carry out a DPIA on a specific processing operation,\ndepending on security or operational needs.\n\n16\n\nSee the GRA Guidance Note IR03/17 Guidance on the General Data Protection Regulation: (3) Data Protection\nOfficer\n(https://www.gra.gi/dataprotection/guidance-on-the-general-data-protection-regulation/gdpr3).\nFor\nprocessing under Part III of the DPA, see Sections 78-80 of the DPA, relating to the requirements for the\ndesignation, position and tasks of a DPO.\n17\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 80(1)(b) of the DPA, which stipulates the tasks the DPO\nmust undertake in regard to the DPIA. In this respect, the DPO must provide advice on the carrying out of the\nDPIA and monitor compliance with Section 73 of the DPA.\n\n12\n\n\f6.3 What is the methodology to carry out a DPIA?\nAs described earlier in Section 2, there are certain requirements that must be included in a\nDPIA. Beyond this, a data controller may adapt or develop a DPIA in a manner that is\nappropriate to the processing activity or activities it undertakes.\nThere are a number of established methodologies within the EU and worldwide which take\naccount of the components of a DPIA as described in the GDPR. The development of sector\nspecific DPIA frameworks is also encouraged, as the inclusion of sectoral knowledge may allow\nDPIAs to address the specifics of a particular type of processing operation (for example,\nparticular types of data, corporate assets, potential impacts, threats, measures etc.).\nIt is up to the data controller to choose a methodology, however, regardless of its form, a\nDPIA must be a genuine assessment of risks, allowing data controllers to take measures to\naddress them. Further, where necessary, the data controller should carry out a review to\nassess if the processing is performed in accordance with the DPIA at least when there is a\nchange of risk represented by the processing operation (see Article 35(11) of the GDPR).\nTo assist data controllers, the Commissioner provides an example of a DPIA methodology in\nANNEX A.\n\n6.4 Publishing a DPIA\nPublishing a DPIA is not mandatory under the GDPR. However, data controllers should\nconsider publishing their DPIA, part of their DPIA, or even a summary of their DPIA, for various\nreasons.\nPublishing a DPIA may help foster trust in the data controller\u2019s processing operations and\ndemonstrate accountability and transparency. It is particularly good practice to publish a DPIA\nwhere members of the public are affected by the processing operation. This could particularly\nbe the case where a public authority carries out a DPIA.\nThe published DPIA does not need to contain the whole assessment, especially when the DPIA\ncould present specific information concerning security risks for the data controller or give away\ntrade secrets or commercially sensitive information. It could simply consist of a summary of\nthe DPIA\u2019 s main findings, or even a statement that a DPIA has been carried out.\nHowever, when high residual risks cannot be mitigated, the Commissioner is to be consulted18\nand the DPIA must be provided (Article 36(3)(e) of the GDPR)19. The Commissioner may\n\n18\n\nSee Article 36(1), Recital 84 and Recital 92 of the GDPR. Note that for processing under Part III of the DPA,\nwhere, under Section 74(1) of the DPA, a controller intends to create a filing system, prior consultation in the\ncontext of DPIAs is required as prescribed by Section 74(2) of the DPA.\n19\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 74(3)(a) of the DPA.\n\n13\n\n\fprovide his advice and will not compromise trade secrets or reveal security vulnerabilities,\nsubject to the principles applicable on public access to official documents.\n\n7 . CONSULTING THE SUPERVISORY\nAUTHORITY\nGDPR - Article 36 (1)\nThe controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data\nprotection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result\nin a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.\n\nAs outlined above, the Commissioner must be consulted if residual risks are high and data\ncontrollers are unable to appropriately mitigate risks when conducting a DPIA.20\nFor example, the processing of medical data on a large scale is likely to result in a high risk,\nand therefore likely to require a DPIA. In such cases, it is the obligation of the data controller\nto evaluate the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and to identify the measures21\nenvisaged to reduce those risks to an adequate level, and to demonstrate compliance with\nthe GDPR (Article 35(7)of the GDPR)22.\nMeasures could include appropriate technical and organisational security procedures (for\nexample, effective full disk encryption, robust key management, appropriate access control,\nsecured backups, etc.) on laptops storing personal data, along with existing policies (such as\nnotice, consent, right of access, right to object, etc.). This example demonstrates how risks\ncan be managed by data controllers and how such processing can proceed without consulting\nthe Commissioner where all identified risks have been sufficiently addressed.\nIn cases where the residual risks remain high and cannot be adequately mitigated, such as\ninstances where the data subjects may encounter significant or even irreversible\nconsequences which they may not overcome (for example, unauthorised access to data\nleading to a threat on the life of data subjects), and/or when it seems obvious that the risk\nwill occur (for example, where a data controller cannot reduce the number of individuals\naccessing the data because of its sharing), the data controller must consult the Commissioner\n(see Recital 84 of the GDPR).\n\n20\n\nSee Article 36(1), Recital 84 and Recital 92 of the GDPR. Note that for processing under Part III of the DPA,\nwhere, under Section 74(1) of the DPA, a controller intends to create a filing system, prior consultation in the\ncontext of DPIAs is required as prescribed by Section 74(2) of the DPA.\n21\n\nIncluding taking account of existing guidance from the EDPB and supervisory authorities and taking account\nof the state of the art and the costs of implementation as prescribed by Article 35(1) of the GDPR.\n22\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(3)(c) and (d) of the DPA.\n\n14\n\n\fFurther, the controller will have to consult and/or obtain prior authorisation from the\nCommissioner whenever Gibraltar law requires a data controller to do so in relation to\nprocessing for the performance of a task carried out by the data controller in the public\ninterest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health (Article 36(5)\nof the GDPR).\nRegardless of whether consultation is required, based on the level of residual risk, an\norganisation will still need to meet their obligations of retaining a record of the DPIA and must\nupdate the DPIA as and when necessary.\n\n15\n\n\fANNEX A \u2013 An example of a DPIA methodology\n\nStep 1: Identify the need for a DPIA in relation to the envisaged processing\noperations and purposes (where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the\ncontroller).\n1. Describe and record legitimate reasons for undertaking the project, the overall aims\nand intended outcomes.23\n- This should include a functional description of the processing operation, taking\ninto account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing (Recital\n90 of the GDPR)24.\n2. Develop and answer a set of screening questions to identify a proposal\u2019s potential\nimpact on privacy.\n- This should clarify and record what personal data is going to be used, who the\nrecipients of the data will be and the period for which the personal data will be\nstored.\n- Organisations should also identify the assets on which personal data rely\n(hardware, software, networks, people, paper or paper transmission channels).\n3. Consider how the project management activity can address privacy issues.\n- Organisations should take into account compliance with approved codes of\nconduct (Article 35(8) of the GDPR).\n- Certifications, seals and marks for the purpose of demonstrating compliance\nwith the GDPR of processing operations by controllers and processors (Article\n42), as well as Binding Corporate Rules (BCR)25, should be taken into account\nas well.\n4. Begin to discuss privacy issues with stakeholders and involve interested parties.\n- Seek advice of the DPO (Article 35(2) of the GDPR)26.\n- Seek assistance and information from the processor as required in Article\n28(3)(f) of the GDPR27.\n- Seek the views of data subjects or their representatives (Article 35(9) of the\nGDPR).\n5. Adapt the project development process to address privacy concerns.\nThe above is a generic approach, the level of detail can be decided by the organisation and\nwill depend on various factors, including the time and resources available to the project team,\nalthough this should not impact the effectiveness of the DPIA or the controller\u2019s ability to\ncomply with GDPR and/or DPA requirements.\n\n23\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 74(2) and 73(3)(a) of the DPA.\n\n24\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(4) of the DPA.\n\n25\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Chapter 5 of Part III of the DPA regarding transfers of personal\ndata to third countries.\n26\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 80(1)(b) of the DPA.\n\n27\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see the obligations of data processors as stipulated in Section 69 of\nthe DPA and specific obligations with respect to security at Section 75 of the DPA.\n\n16\n\n\fAnother important aspect of a DPIA is describing information flows in a project. This process\ncan help organisations identify unforeseen or unintended uses of data, for example data\nsharing.\nTo describe information flows, organisations should explain and document how information\nwill be processed. Information flows may be integrated into similar exercises already\ncompleted or envisaged, such as information audits, information maps, user journeys or\ninformation asset registers. Project proposals or similar documents that may have been\nproduced to determine how personal data might be processed within a project, are also useful\nfor this activity.\nInformation flows may be recorded in a format that meets the needs of the organisation. This\nshould then be used as part of the final DPIA report.\nIf the data controller decides that a DPIA is not to be carried out, it is recommended that a\nrecord of this first step is nevertheless kept.\n\nStep 2: Assess necessity and proportionality of processing.\nIn order to complete this step, organisations must assess and document the necessity and\nproportionality of the project in relation to the purposes for conducting the project (Article 35\n(7)(b) of the GDPR)28.\nTo comply with GDPR requirements, organisations should \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\ndetermine the extent to which a project collects and processes personal data for\nspecified, explicit and legitimate purposes, as noted in Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR;\nensure that the personal data processed is adequate, relevant and limited to what is\nnecessary, as specified in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR;\nestablish a policy for the project that guarantees limited storage duration of personal\ndata, as noted in Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR; and\nensure the lawfulness of processing as outlined in Article 6 of the GDPR29.\n\nMeeting the above requirements will help organisations evaluate whether the impact on\nprivacy is proportionate to the outcomes to be achieved by a particular project.\n\nStep 3: Identify the privacy and related risks to the rights of individuals.30\n\nAt this stage, organisations should assess the potential privacy issues associated with a\nproject. Risks to individuals can be categorised in different ways and it is important that all\ntypes of risks are considered. These can range from risks of physical safety, material impacts\n(such as financial loss) or moral impacts (such as distress caused).\n\n28\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, note that Section 73 of the DPA does not explicitly state that the\nnecessity and proportionality of the processing must be recorded as part of the DPIA. However, an assessment of\nthese aspects of the processing would nevertheless assist in demonstrating compliance with Section 73(3)(b) and\n73(3)(d) of the DPA.\n29\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see the requirements in regard to the principles of processing in\nChapter 2 of Part III of the DPA.\n30\n\nSee Article 35(7)(c) of the DPA. For processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(3)(b) of the DPA.\n\n17\n\n\fThis step does not require organisations to decide on a particular method to carry out a DPIA.\nOrganisations may implement their existing project management or risk management\nmethodologies to help them identify risks and adjust them as appropriate.\nHowever, the DPIA process must specifically include an evaluation of risks posed to the rights\nof data subjects31 as listed below \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthe right to be informed (Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR);\nthe right of access (Article 15 of the GDPR);\nthe right to rectification (Article 16 of the GDPR);\nthe right to erasure (Article 17 of the GDPR);\nthe right to restrict processing (Article 18 of the GDPR);\nthe right to data portability (Article 20 of the GDPR);\nthe right to object (Article 21 of the GDPR); and\nrights in relation to automated decision making and profiling (Article 22 of the GDPR).\n\nAdditionally, as well as considering and complying with the GDPR Articles more generally,\norganisations must also pay particular attention to the GDPR requirements which relate to the\nfollowing \u2022\n\u2022\n\ndata processor(s) (Article 28 of the GDPR)32; and\nprior consultation (Article 36 of the GDPR)33.\n\nIt is essential that all of the identified privacy risks are recorded at this stage. It may also be\nuseful to use a privacy risk register to describe the risks in terms of origin, nature, particularity,\nlikelihood and severity (Recital 90 of the GDPR). Small scale projects may have a less formal\napproach to risk, and this can also be reflected in the privacy risk register.\n\nStep 4: Identify and evaluate the measures to address risks (privacy solutions).34\nOrganisations need to identify possible privacy solutions to address the risks that have been\nidentified in the above steps.\nA DPIA should set out the organisation\u2019s options for addressing each risk that has been\nidentified and state whether each option would result in the risk being \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\neliminated;\nreduced; or\naccepted.\n\n31\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see the requirements in regard to the rights of data subjects in Chapter\n3 of Part III of the DPA.\n32\n\nFor processing under Part III of the DPA, see the obligations of data processors as stipulated in Section 69 of\nthe DPA and specific obligations with respect to security at Section 75 of the DPA.\n33\n\nNote that for processing under Part III of the DPA, where, under Section 74(1) of the DPA, a controller intends\nto create a filing system, prior consultation in the context of DPIAs is required as prescribed by Section 74(2) of\nthe DPA.\n34\n\nSee Article 35(7)(d) of the DPA. For processing under Part III of the DPA, see Section 73(3)(c) and (d) of the\nDPA.\n\n18\n\n\fIt is important to remember that the aim of a DPIA is not to completely eliminate any impact\na project may have on privacy. The purpose of the DPIA is to reduce the impact to an\nacceptable level while still allowing a useful project to be implemented.\nOrganisations will need to assess the costs and benefits of possible privacy solutions. Some\ncosts will be financial, for example an organisation might need to purchase additional software\nto give greater control over data access and retention. The costs can be balanced against the\nbenefits, for example the increased assurance against a data breach, and the reduced risk of\nregulatory action and reputational damage.\nThere are many different steps which organisations can take to reduce a privacy risk. Some\nof the more likely measures include \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\ndeciding not to collect or store particular types of information;\ndevising retention periods which only keep information for as long as necessary and\nplanning secure destruction of information;\nimplementing appropriate technological security measures;\nensuring that staff are properly trained and are aware of potential privacy risks;\ndeveloping ways to safely anonymise the information when it is possible to do so;\nproducing guidance for staff on how to use new systems and how to share data if\nappropriate;\nusing systems which allow individuals to access their information more easily and make\nit simpler to respond to subject access requests;\ntaking steps to ensure that individuals are fully aware of how their information is used\nand can contact the organisation for assistance if necessary;\nselecting data processors who will provide a greater degree of security and ensuring\nthat agreements are in place to protect the information which is processed on an\norganisation\u2019s behalf; and/or\nproducing data sharing agreements which make clear what information will be shared,\nhow it will be shared and who it will be shared with.\n\nPrivacy risks and solutions should be recorded on a privacy risk register, as mentioned in the\nprevious step. The privacy risk register should be updated to reflect how these measures have\nchanged the level of risk. When an organisation accepts risks, it should explain why it has\ndecided to do so. The register should record each risk, explain what action has been taken or\nwill be taken and identify who is responsible for approving and implementing the solution.\n\nStep 5: Sign off and record/document the DPIA outcomes to demonstrate\ncompliance.\nThis step emphasises the importance of keeping a record of the DPIA as this will ensure the\nnecessary measures are implemented to appropriately identify and reduce privacy risks. It can\nalso be used to assure the public and other stake holders that the project has been thoroughly\nassessed.\nThe report should include the following \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nan overview of the project, explaining why it was undertaken and how it will impact\non privacy;\nmaterial or references to the material produced throughout the previous DPIA steps,\nfor example the description of data flows and the privacy risk register; and\na description of how the privacy risks were identified and how they will be addressed.\n19\n\n\fA DPIA does not necessarily require a formal signing-off process but this will depend on the\nnature of the project. If an organisation is working on large-scale project with a higher level\nof risk, it would be good practice to ensure that the DPIA has been approved at a senior level.\nFor smaller projects, it can be appropriate for the project leader to accept the privacy risks. A\nsigning-off can also help to ensure that the necessary actions are followed up.\nImportant: The Commissioner does not take a role in approving or signing-off DPIAs. This\nprocess has been developed to focus on self-assessment, and every DPIA relies on an\norganisation\u2019s understanding of its own practices.\n\nStep 6: Integrate the outcomes into the project plan.\nThe results of the DPIA should be fed back into the wider project management process. This\nwill usually need to take place while the project is still being developed.\nOrganisations should take care to ensure that the steps taken as a result of the DPIA have\nbeen properly implemented and are having the desired effect.\nIf a project develops or changes during its lifecycle, the organisation may need to revisit the\nscreening questions to ensure the DPIA is still appropriate. This might be especially important\nwith particular project management methodologies which may not have a fixed set of\nrequirements at the outset.\nAs with other aspects of the DPIA, a review of the privacy outcomes can be built into existing\nprocedures. If an organisation were to review the general implementation of a new project\nafter a certain period, it should be possible to include a process for checking the work arising\nfrom the DPIA as well. DPIAs should be developed with the aim to integrate them into an\norganisation\u2019s own project management processes and most project management\nmethodologies include a post project review.\n\n20\n\n\fANNEX B \u2013 List of processing operations for which a DPIA is required\nAs detailed above in Section 3, below is a list of processing operations that are considered to\nrequire a DPIA. This list is based on guidelines adopted by the EDPB on DPIAs (WP248rev01).\nOur list therefore complements and further specifies these guidelines. The list will be updated\nin accordance with developments.\n1. Innovative technology: Processing involving the use of innovative technologies, or the\nnovel application of current technologies (including AI). A DPIA is mandatory for this type\nof processing when combined with any of the criteria within the European guidelines.\n2. Denial of service: Data processing that affects an individual\u2019s access to a product,\nservice, opportunity or benefit, due to automated decision-making, profiling or involves\nthe processing of special category data.\n3. Large-scale profiling: A DPIA is required for any large-scale profiling of individuals.\n4. Biometrics: A DPIA is compulsory for any processing of biometric data when it is\ncombined with any of the criteria from the European guidelines.\n5. Genetic data: Any processing of genetic data, other than that processed by an individual\nGP or health professional for the provision of health care direct to the data subject. A\nDPIA is required where this processing is combined with any of the criteria from the\nEuropean guidelines.\n6. Data matching: Processing that involves the combination, comparison or matching of\npersonal data attained from more than one source.\n7. Invisible processing: When personal data is processed without being directly obtained\nfrom the data subject due to an impossible or disproportionate effort to comply with\nArticle 14 of the GDPR. A DPIA is mandatory for this type of processing when combined\nwith any of the criteria within the European guidelines.\n8. Tracking: Data processing involving the tracking of an individual\u2019s location or behaviour,\nincluding online activity.

INTRODUCTION\nTo process personal data legitimately under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the Data Protection Act 2004\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) organisations need to have a \u2018lawful basis\u2019. Identifying the lawful basis that an organisation relies on to process personal\ndata is a fundamental step in ensuring data protection compliance.\nThe GDPR and the DPA list the lawful bases that organisations can rely on, depending on the \u2018category\u2019 of personal data i.e. whether\nthe information is \u2018personal data\u2019, \u2018a special category of personal data\u2019 or \u2018data relating to criminal convictions and offences\u2019. This\nGuidance Note aims to identify the lawful bases that are available for organisations to rely on, for each category, in a practical and\nconcise manner.\nThe information provided should be treated as guidance with appropriate consideration being given to the actual legal requirements.\nFootnotes referencing the legislation are included so that readers are able to link and relate the guidance to the specific provisions\nin the law.\n\n2. GENERAL GUIDANCE\n\u2022\n\nThe lawful basis that is most appropriate to use will depend on the circumstances of the organisation and purposes of the\nprocessing.\n\n\u2022\n\nMost lawful bases require that processing is \u2018necessary\u2019. In these cases, the lawful basis cannot be relied on when an\norganisation can reasonably achieve the same purpose without the processing.\n\n\u2022\n\nOrganisations must identify and document its lawful basis, including the reasoning for relying on the lawful basis identified,\nbefore it begins collecting and using personal data. This is important and useful as the accountability principle1 requires\norganisations to be able to demonstrate compliance. It is also important and necessary for the transparency requirements,\nwhich oblige organisations to inform individuals upfront about the lawful basis that they rely on to process their information2.\n\n\u2022\n\nOrganisations may find that more than one lawful basis could apply in a particular case. If so, the organisation may identify\nand document all of them. In some cases, more than one basis applies to the processing because the processing has more\nthan one purpose, and if this is the case this should be identified from the start.\n\n\u2022\n\nIf a public authority can demonstrate that the processing is to perform tasks as set down in Gibraltar law, then it will be able\nto use the public task basis. If not, it may still be able to consider consent or legitimate interests in some cases, depending\non the nature of the processing and its relationship with individuals. There is no absolute ban on public authorities using\nconsent or legitimate interests as their lawful basis, but the GDPR does restrict public authorities\u2019 use of these two bases.\n\n1\n\nArticle 5(2) of the GDPR\n\n2\n\nArticle 13(1)(c) of the GDPR\n\n2\n\n\f3. THE THREE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL\nDATA\nThe law differentiates between \u2018personal data\u2019, \u2018special categories of personal data\u2019 and \u2018data relating to criminal convictions and\noffences\u2019.\n\u2022\n\nPersonal data - in summary, if you can associate information with an individual, it is personal data. e.g. name, address, IP,\ntelephone number, physical characteristics, life history, location data, etc\u2026 The law defines personal data as follows \u2013\n\u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data\nsubject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in\nparticular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an\nonline identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,\neconomic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\nWithin the broad definition of personal data, the law gives a distinctive status to certain types of personal data, which are defined\nas \u2018special categories of personal data\u2019 and \u2018data relating to criminal convictions\u2019. Both categories are considered more sensitive,\nrequire greater protection and can only be processed in more limited circumstances.\n\u2022\n\nSpecial categories of personal data \u2013 defined in law as follows \u2013\npersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,\nor trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of\nuniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's\nsex life or sexual orientation.\n\n\u2022\n\nData relating to criminal convictions and offences \u2013 defined simply as data relating to criminal convictions and offences or\nrelated security measures.\n\n4. PERSONAL DATA\nThe lawful bases that organisations can rely on to process personal data are the following \u2013\n4.1.\n\nConsent3: the individual has given clear consent to process their personal data for a specific purpose.\n\n4.2.

With rising expectations\ntowards continuous availability of services, immaculate user experience and\neffective protection of sensitive data, the strengthening of Saudi Arabia\u2019s\ncybersecurity becomes crucial to increase the digital nation\u2019s trust in safe and\nresilient ICT infrastructure and services.\n\n2.\n\nPurpose\nThe CRF provides requirements for better management of cybersecurity risks\nthrough a consistent approach and in line with international best practices and\nlocal cybersecurity regulations. The purpose of the CRF is:\n\u2022 To regulate and empower the cybersecurity practices of the ICT sector.\n\u2022 To increase the overall cybersecurity maturity level of the ICT sector.\n\u2022 To define a comprehensive set of cybersecurity requirements that shall be\nimplemented based on a risk-oriented approach.\n\u2022 To encourage the ICT sector to apply good practices for establishing the\nappropriate cybersecurity measures.\n\u2022 To ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the services provided\nto the customers.\n\n3.\n\nScope\nThis CRF provides a comprehensive set of cybersecurity requirements that must\nbe implemented by the LSPs to fulfill the minimum security requirements.\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of CITC regulations and other related\nregulations, the provisions of this Framework shall apply to licensed service\nproviders. It is important to understand that this framework is not intended to\noverwrite, and should not be perceived as a replacement of any of the issued\nregulatory frameworks.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 3 of 52\n\n\f4.\n\nApplicability\nThis framework is applicable to all the LSPs and their subsidiaries, staff, third\nparties and customers. Each LSP is required to comply with all applicable\nrequirements through developing their own way of achieving the cybersecurity\nobjectives.\nBecause the requirements were chosen to be comprehensive, some requirements\nmight not be applicable for every LSP. For example if an LSP does not develop\nsoftware, then compliance with the secure software development (Category ID:\n4.14) requirements will not be required in this case. The control will remain\napplicable in case software is developed via a third party.\n\n5.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\nResponsibilities of CITC include:\n1. Monitor and steer the LSPs compliance with the\ndefined requirements through various ways, for\nexample inspections of LSPs facilities, compliance\nworkshops, active and reactive audits.\n2. Periodically review and update the CRF.\n3.\nDefine compliance requirements and setting target\ndates to ensure LSPs compliance with the CRF.\nResponsibilities of the LSPs include:\n1. Adopt and implement CRF in accordance with the\ndefined compliance requirements.\n2. Provide compliance reporting through for example\nself-assessments or other different means upon\nrequest from CITC.\n3. Provide information and documentation to CITC\nwhen requested in addition to the defined reporting\nin the CRF.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 4 of 52\n\n\f6.\n\nGlossary\n\nThe words and expressions defined in CITC Statutes shall have the same meaning when used\nin this document.

Each level comprises of a set of cybersecurity controls. The\nthree levels vary in the complexity of the controls.\nLevel 1 includes the basic security controls.\nLevel 2 includes advanced requirements in addition the existing requirements\nwithin Level 1.\nLevel 3 includes requirements that are focusing on efficiency monitoring and\ncontinuous improvement to the controls in Levels 1 and 2.\nIn order to achieve compliance with a higher level, compliance with all preceding\nlevels is required.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 10 of 52\n\n\fLevel 3\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 1\n\nFigure 1 - Compliance Levels\n\nThe criticality of the LSP defines the target compliance level and date, which will\nbe officially communicated by CITC (via e.g. memos, website).\n2.\n\nStructure of the controls\nThe CRF controls are grouped into six domains:\n\nFigure 2 - CRF Domains\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 11 of 52\n\n\fEach domain is broken down into more specific categories that group\ncybersecurity controls relevant to the specific topic and share the same objective.\n\nFigure 3 - CRF Domains and Categories\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 12 of 52\n\n\fFigure 4 - CRF Structure\n\nImportant notes\nParticular control information such as [processes], [outcomes], and\n[references] (e.g. to other controls, categories, processes, CITC documents) are\nindividually highlighted throughout the framework. Where applicable,\nspecific] control considerations are highlighted as well.\n\n[ICT-\n\nThe controls within the CRF are interconnected, for example an outcome from\na control in one category could be an input to another control within a different\ncategory (e.g. the [Vulnerabilities Report] generated in the Vulnerability\nManagement category acts as an input to the Patch Management category).\nThe highlighted processes and outcomes cover most but not necessarily all\ncybersecurity measures. They just emphasize expected implementations of\nprocesses and outcomes to improve the usability and clarity of the CRF\ncontrols.\nThe symbols used in the CRF are listed below:\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 13 of 52\n\n\fCRF Symbol Legend\nNew Outcome\nOutcome\nNew Process\nProcess\nReference\nICT-specific\n3. Documentation of Requirements\nIn almost all CRF categories, documenting the requirements will be the first\nstep of the implementation by the LSP. The CRF does not prescribe a standard\nformat for the documentation of the requirements mentioned in each of the\ncategories. These requirements can be defined in form of directives, rules,\nstandards or policy documents. However, the requirements document \u2013\nregardless of its name \u2013 must at least include the following:\nUnique document title\nDocument version number and date\nDocument change tracker\nDocument owner responsible for changes\nThe requirements document must be officially approved by the authorized\npersonnel/committee within the organization\n\u2022 The requirements documents must be appropriately disseminated and\ncommunicated to all relevant stakeholders within the organization\n\u2022 Roles and responsibilities for the definition and the approval of the\nrequirements of the category.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nDocuments that do not fulfil the above requirements will not be qualified to be\ncompliant with the control requirements.\n\nCybersecurity Regulatory Framework\n\nPage 14 of 52\n\n\f4.

        "input": "The Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017\n(\u201cthe Law\u201d)\n\nNotification of Personal Data Breaches\nIntroduction\nThe Law is based around seven principles of \u2018good information handling\u2019. These principles\ngive people (data subjects) specific rights in relation to their personal information and place\ncertain obligations on those organisations that are responsible for processing it.\nBreach reporting is a specific requirement under the Law and a copy of the Law can be found\nhere.\nThis guidance explains to organisations when and how to notify the Office of the Data\nProtection Authority (\u201cthe ODPA\u201d) about a personal data breach.\nBreach reports can be made via the secure breach reporting facility on our website :https://odpc.gg/breach-reporting/.\nOverview\n\u2022\n\nThis guidance applies to controllers, as defined under section 111 of the Law .\n\n\u2022\n\nControllers must provide the ODPA with written notice of a personal data breach (a\nbreach) as soon as practicable and in any event no later than 72 hours after becoming\naware of the breach. Where full details are not yet known, the initial notification may be\nfollowed up with further details as soon as practicable.\n\n\u2022\n\nAll breaches that come to the attention of the controller after 25 May 2018 must be\nconsidered for reporting, regardless of when they occurred.\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\nJuly 2019\n\n\f\u2022\n\nWhere a controller uses the services of a processor, the processor is required under\nsection 42(1) of the Law to give the controller notice of a breach as soon as they become\naware of it.\n\n\u2022\n\nWork is ongoing to prepare the reporting mechanism controllers will use to report a\nbreach to the ODPA. Further information will be released once this is finalised. In the\nmeantime, a form showing the information that will need to be reported is attached at\nthe end of this guidance for your information.\n\n\u2022\n\nIf it is likely that the breach will pose a high risk to the significant interests of a data\nsubject, the controller must also notify those individuals:\no\no\no\no\n\n\u2022\n\nAs soon as practicable;\nIn clear and plain language;\nDescribing the nature of the breach; and\nProviding them with the name and contact details of the controller\u2019s data\nprotection officer (DPO) or other relevant contact, a description of the likely\nconsequences of the breach and the measures taken or proposed to be taken by\nthe controller to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to\nmitigate its possible adverse effects.\n\nControllers must also keep a log of any breaches in accordance with section 42(6) of the\nLaw. A template form for this purpose can be found at Appendix 1 but organisations can\nuse their own if they wish.\n\nRelevant breaches\nUnder section 42 of the Law, controllers have a specific obligation to notify the ODPA \u2013\u2013 about\na breach, unless the breach is \u2018unlikely to result in a risk to the significant interests of a data\nsubject.\nThey are also required to keep a log of those breaches in accordance with section 42(6) of the\nLaw.\nControllers are also required to disclose details of the breach to affected data subjects where\nthere is a high risk to their significant interests (section 43)\nIt is important to remember that the purpose of these provisions is to protect individuals\u2019\npersonal data by ensuring appropriate steps are taken. Therefore, it is important for\norganisations to consider the type of personal data they hold and whether any breach could\nadversely affect an individual \u2013 for example by causing financial loss, reputational damage or\nidentity fraud both at the time of the breach and in the future.\nIf an organisation is responsible for delivering part of a service for a controller but does not\nhave a direct contractual relationship with the data subject, it does not have to notify the\nODPA of a breach but it must immediately notify the relevant controller (who will have the\ncontractual relationship with the data subject.) It will be for the controller to notify the ODPA\nand the data subject, as appropriate.\nWhat is a breach?\nA breach is defined in section 111(1) of the Law as:\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\f\u201cpersonal data breach\u201d means a breach of security leading to the accidental or\nunlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,\npersonal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed\u201d\nThere will be a breach whenever any personal data (including any special category data) is\naccidentally lost, corrupted or disclosed, or if someone accesses it or passes it on without\nproper authorisation to do so.\nA breach may be broadly defined as an incident that affected the availability, integrity or\nconfidentiality of the personal data. This therefore includes a network intrusion by an\nunauthorised third party and also a deliberate or accidental act by a service provider that\ndisrupts the availability of personal data to those that need to use it. For example, the\nunintended deletion of personal data where no appropriate back-up exists would constitute\na breach.\nMore information on what constitutes \u2018personal data\u2019 can be found here.\nNotifying the ODPC\nSection 42(2) of the Law states:\n\u2018Where a controller becomes aware of a personal data breach, the controller must\ngive the Authority written notice of it as soon as practicable, and in any event, no\nlater than 72 hours after becoming so aware,\nControllers must therefore tell the ODPA no later than 72 hours of becoming aware that a\nbreach has occurred. If a notification is not made to the ODPA within 72 hours, the\nnotification must be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the delay (section\n42(3)(e) of the Law).\nIt is accepted that in some cases it may not be feasible to provide full details within 72 hours.\nIn such cases, section 42(4) of the Law states that:\n\u2018Where it is impracticable to give the Authority all of the required information at\nthe same time as the notice is given, the controller may provide the information in\nphases as soon as practicable\u2019\nAccordingly, a controller should still make the initial notification within 72 hours, to inform\nthe ODPA that a breach has been detected and to provide the relevant details. This should\nthen be followed up with any of the outstanding information and a follow up form is attached\nat the end of this document.\nIt may be the case that controllers need to undertake an investigation to understand exactly\nwhat has happened and what needs to be done to mitigate the breach, and that in some cases\nthis will take longer than 72 hours. However, controllers must still notify the ODPA of the\nbreach within 72 hours of having become aware of it and submit a follow-up notification as\nappropriate.\nBreach reports can be made via the secure breach reporting facility on our website :https://odpa.gg/breach-reporting/.\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\fWhat information to include\nThe initial notification (within 72 hours) should ordinarily include the following summary\ninformation:\n\u2022 The name of the controller\n\u2022 The name and contact details of the DPO or other point of contact where more\ninformation can be obtained\n\u2022 Whether it is a first or subsequent notification\n\u2022 The date and time of the breach (or best estimate)\n\u2022 The date and time of the controller becoming aware of the breach\n\u2022 The nature and content of the personal data concerned\n\u2022 Technical and organisational measures applied (or that will be applied) to the\naffected personal data\n\u2022 The name of the organisation affected by the data breach (if different from the\ncontroller)\nIf possible, the initial notification should also include the more detailed information set out\nbelow. Otherwise, this should be included in any follow notifications until full details have\nbeen provided:\n\u2022 A summary of the incident that caused the breach, including the physical location\nof the breach\n\u2022 The number and category of data subjects concerned\n\u2022 The number and category of personal data records concerned\n\u2022 The likely consequences of the personal data breach and potential adverse effects\non the data subjects\n\u2022 The technical and organisational measures taken or proposed to be taken to\nmitigate those potential adverse effects\n\u2022 The content of any notification provided to affected data subjects (where\nrelevant)\n\u2022 The means of communication used to notify the affected data subjects (where\nrelevant)\n\u2022 The number of data subjects notified (where relevant)\n\u2022 Whether the breach affects data subjects in any jurisdiction other than the\nBailiwick of Guernsey\n\u2022 Details relating the notification with any other data protection authorities\n\u2022 If these details cannot be included in any second notification, a reasoned\njustification for the further delay\nWhat happens next\nThe information provided will be recorded by the ODPA and used to assess whether the\ncontroller is complying or has complied with its obligations under the Law, including the duty\nto take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data of\nthe data subjects, the duty to notify the ODPA of a breach and the duty to notify data subject\nof a breach which is likely to result in a risk to their significant interests.\nUpon submission of an initial notification a controller will receive confirmation of receipt from\nthe ODPA. An officer of the ODPA will contact the controller to indicate what the next steps\nwill be.\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\fWhere a breach has affected or is likely to affect data subjects in jurisdictions outside of the\nBailiwick of Guernsey, the ODPA may be required to communicate and cooperate with the\nrelevant data protection authority in that jurisdiction / those jurisdictions in accordance with\nits statutory duties.\nNotifying Data Subjects\nSection 43 of the Law states:\n\u201cWhere a controller becomes aware of a personal data breach that is likely to pose\na high risk to the significant interests of a data subject, the controller must give the\ndata subject written notice of the breach as soon as practicable.\nControllers are therefore also required to notify those individuals affected by the breach if\nsuch is likely to result in any risk to their significant interests. Examples of such risks include\nfinancial loss, reputational damage, adverse impact of safety or wellbeing, and identity fraud.\nThis list is not exhaustive and decisions should be informed by the nature, scope, context and\npurpose of the compromised personal data.\nWhether the breach is likely to result in a risk to the significant interests of the data subject is\nprimarily a decision for the controller and should be based on the circumstances of the case.\nThe ODPA considers that controllers should consider the following factors:\na. The nature and content of the personal data\nb. Whether it includes special category data (as defined in the Law)\nc. What harm could be caused to the individual both now and in the future \u2013 and in\nparticular, whether there is a threat to the individual\u2019s physical safety or\nreputation, identity theft, fraud, financial loss, psychological distress or\nhumiliation\nd. Who may now have access to the data, to the extent this is known.\nSection 43 of the Law states that a controller does not have to notify data subjects if the\n\u201cthe controller has established and carried out appropriate technical and\norganisational measures to protect personal data, and those measures were\napplied to the personal data affected by the breach, in particular those that render\nthe personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it,\nsuch as encryption\u201d or if the controller has taken \u201csubsequent measures which\nensure that the high risk to the significant interests of data subjects referred to in\nsubsection (1) is no longer likely to materialize\u201d].\nSimilarly, the controller does not have to notify data subjects \u201cif performing that duty would\ninvolve disproportionate effort\u201d, in which case the controller must publish a notice (without\nmaking public any personal data) or take any other step equivalent to publication in order to\ninform the data subject in an equally effective manner\u201d (section 43(5) of the Law).\nWhat to tell data subjects\nIn accordance with section 43 of the Law any notice to data subjects must include the\nfollowing information:\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\f\u2022 A description of the nature of the breach\n\u2022 The name and contact details of the data protection officer or other source where more\ninformation can be obtained\n\u2022 A description of the likely consequences of the breach\n\u2022 A description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address\nthe breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate the possible adverse\neffects.\nIn addition, it is recommended that the notification to data subjects includes a helpline\nnumber or web address, if possible.\nThe notification must be in clear and plain language. You may wish to consider publishing the\nnotification in more than one language, depending on the nationalities of the data subjects\naffected.\nIt should be noted that whilst the decision whether or not to notify the affected data subject\nof the breach initially rests with the controller, the ODPA can require the controller to do so\nif, in its opinion, there exists a high risk to the significant interests of the data subject.\nWhen to notify data subjects\nControllers must notify affected data subjects without undue delay \u2013 in other words, as soon\nas the controller has sufficient information about the breach.\nKeeping a Log of Personal Data breaches\nSection 42(6) of the Law requires controllers to keep a written record of any breach:\n\u201cIn any case, a controller must keep a written record of each personal data breach\nof which the controller is aware, including \u2013\n(a) The facts relating to the breach,\n(b) The effects of the breach,\n(c) The remedial action taken, and\nAny steps taken by the controller to comply with this section, including whether the\ncontroller gave a notice to the Authority under subsection (2), and if so, a copy of\nthe notice..\u201d\nThe ODPA has created a template log to help you record the information you need \u2013 see\nAppendix 1.\nThe ODPA will inspect such logs if a controller becomes subject to an audit pursuant to\nSchedule 7, paragraph 9 of the Law. The logs and any other relevant information will be used\nto check that controllers are complying with their obligations under the Law.\nMore Information\nIf you need any further information about this, or any other aspect of the Law, please contact\nthe ODPA or go to website www.odpa.gg.\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\fChecklist\n\u2610 We are clear about our breach reporting duties\n\u2610 We have robust breach detection in place\n\u2610 We have a breach response plan\n\u2610 We have allocated responsibility for the handling, management, and oversight of\nbreaches\n\u2610 All staff have received appropriate training about prevention, detection and\nmanagement of breaches\n\u2610 We have a process to consider the impact of the breach on individuals\n\u2610 We have a process to inform affected individuals where necessary\n\u2610 We document all breaches regardless of the need to report\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\n\fWRITTEN RECORD OF PERSONAL DATA BREACH\nTEMPLATE FOR CONTROLLERS\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nSection 42 of the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017 sets out the legal obligations of a\ncontroller in the event of a personal data breach.
